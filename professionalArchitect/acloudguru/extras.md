## AWS Organizations
- If you receive a single bill monthly for multiple accounts, you're using AWS Organizations.  This is a "legacy" mode supporting only consolidated billing features.  You must migrate your organization to use advanced governance and management capabilities.
    - Note:  After All Features is enabled, it cannot be changed back.
- Concepts and Terms
    - Organization:  All of the accounts that you manage and control in the organization
        - There's a service access report under Organization Activity that displays last accessed services
    - AWS Account:  Smallest unit of management in the Organization
        - Can only sit in one organization at a time
    - Master Account:  Account used to create the organization
        - Payer account
        - Used as a central management and governance hub
    - Organizational Unit (OU): Set of AWS accounts logically grouped within an organization
        - You can nest OUs inside other OUs to form a hierarchical structure
        - An Organizational Unit can have AWS accounts and other Organizational Units as members. This makes the whole structure similar to a tree. The accounts are organized in a hierarchical, tree-like structure.
        - An OU can have only one parent. 
        - An AWS account can be a member of only one OU.
        - One thing to note is that user cannot move an OU to another place from console or CLI command. So user has to create a new OU and move accounts to it
    - Policy:  Document describing controls to be applied to a selected set of accounts
- Capabilities
    - Manage and define your organization and accounts
        - Create new AWS accounts programatically
        - Group accounts into OUs for management
        - Centrally provision accounts (AWS Cloudformation Stacksets)
        - Tag AWS Accounts
        - Manage service quotas (limits) for new accounts (using AWS Service Quotas)
    - Control Access and permissions
        - Deploy console and CLI access to accounts (AWS Single Sign-on)
        - Define permissions based on membership in an organization (aws:PrincipalOrgId condition key)
        - Author fine-grained permission guardrails across accounts (Service Control Policies)
            - SCPs define the maximum available permissions for IAM entities in an account but do not grant specific permissions
            - Can be attached to the root, OUs and individual accounts
            - ![Permissions are the intersection of SCP and IAM Permissions](images/scp_iam_intersection.png)
            - Authoring SCPs
                - Whitelisting - only allow specific actions
                - Blacklisting - block specific actions
                    - Requires and Allow:* to avoid denying access to all servies
                    - Typical evaluation:  Explicit Deny -->Implicit Deny all-->Explicit Allow
                - Sample scenarios:  Deny launching resources outside of specific region(s)
    - Audit, monitor, and secure your environment
        - Aggregate AWS Config data in a central location for compliance auditing of your accounts
        - Centrally create, provision, and modify web application firewalls to secure your applications (AWS Firewall Manager)
        - Accept business agreements for organization accounts (AWS Arttifact)
        - Allow organization-wide notification publishing (AWS Cloudwatch Events)
        - Centrally enable audit logging
            - Ensure that all of your AWS accounts have audit logging enabled centrally
            - Prevent auditing from being modified in an account
            - Have all audit logs consolidated in one central place
    - Share resources across accounts
        - Centrally define critical resources and make them available to your logically isolated workloads in accounts
        - AWS Service Catalog
        - AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)
            - Amazon VPC Transit Gateways and subnets
            - AWS License Manager configurations
            - Amazon Route 53 resolver rules
    - Centrally Manage Costs and billing
        - Consolidate usage across all accounts into a single bill

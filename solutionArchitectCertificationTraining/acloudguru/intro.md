- The AWS Cloud spans 69 Availability Zones within 22 geographic Regions around the world, with announced plans for 9 more Availability Zones and three more Regions in Cape Town, Jakarta, and Milan.
- AWS Well-Architected Framework
    - Set of principles:
        - Stop Guessing Capacity
        - Automate Everything
        - Test at scale
            - Test on a a Replica of Production
        - Adapt and Evolve
        - Be Data Driven
            - Drive decisions through data
        - Practice Practice
            - Through problems at production environment
            - Game Day
    - 5 pillars

        1.  Operational Excellence
            - Design principles:
                1.  Perform operations as code
                2.  Annotate documentation
                3.  Make frequent, small, reversible changes
                4.  Refine operations procedures frequently
                5.  Anticipate failure
                6.  Learn from all operational failures
        2.  Security
            - Design Principles:
                1. Implement a strong identity foundation
                2. Enable traceability
                3. Apply security at all layers
                4. Automate security best practices
                5. Protect data in transit and at rest
                6. Prepare for security events
        3.  Reliability
            - The system should be designed to detect failure and automatically heal itself.
            - Design Principles:
                1. Test recovery procedures
                2. Automatically recover from failure
                3. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
                4. Stop guessing capacity
                5. Manage change in automation
        4.  Performance Efficiency
        5.  Cost optimization
            - Design Principles:
                1. Adopt a consumption model
                2. Measure overall efficiency
                3. Stop spending money on data center operations
                4. Analyze and attribute expenditure
                5. Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership

## Lambda
- Brief history of cloud:
    - Data Centers-->IAAS (EC2)-->PAAS (Ex:  Elastic Beanstalk, cloud provider will provision all infrastructure around the code that you upload)-->Containers (Ex:  docker)-->Serverless (you only pay for execution time of your code)
- Compute Service where you can upload your code and create a lambda function
- Takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code
- No need to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc.
- Usage patterns:
    - Event-driven compute service responding to events such as data changes in S3 or DynamoDB
    - Response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls make using AWS SDKs
- A lambda function can trigger another lambda function
- A million users hitting lambda at once will trigger a million lambda functions
- Traditional Architecture:
    - User-->Route53-->EC2-->DB
- Serverless Architecture:
    - Api Gateway-->Lambda-->Persistence Store
        - Lambda functions scale out instantly and automatically
    - Aim for a serverless DB:  DynamoDB or Serverless Aurora 
- Supported languages:
    - Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, and Ruby code
    - provides a Runtime API which allows you to use any additional programming languages to author your functions
- Pricing:
    - Number of requests:
        - First 1 million are free
        - $0.20/1 million requests
    - Duration:
        - Time your code begins executing until it returns or terminates, rounded up to the neares 100ms
        - Price depends on amount of memory you allocate
        - $0.000001667/GB-second
- Why is lambda cool:
    - No servers
    - Continuous Scaling
    - Very cheap
- Lambda scales out (not up) automatically
- Which AWS Services are serverless:
    - Compute
        - AWS Lambda
        - Lambda@Edge
        - AWS Fargate
    - Storage
        - S3
        - EFT
    - Data Stores
        - DynamoDB
        - Aurora Serverless
    - API proxy
        - API Gateway
    - Application Integration
        - SNS
        - SQS
        - AppSync
        - EventBridge
    - Orchestration
        - Step Functions
    - Analytics
        - Kinesis
        - Athena
- Lambda triggers:
    - Services that invoke lambda functions synchronously:
        - ELB (ALB)
        - Amazon Cognito
        - Amazon Lex
            - Amazon Lex is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces into applications using voice and text.
        - Amazon Alexa
        - Amazon API Gateway
        - Amazon Cloudfront (Lambda@Edge)
        - Amazon kinesis Data Firehose
    - Services that invoke lambda functions asynchronously:
        - S3
        - SNS
        - SES
        - Cloudformation
        - Cloudwatch Logs
        - Cloudwatch Events
        - CodeCommit
        - AWS Config
            - AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
            - You can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. 
            - Enables you to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational troubleshooting.

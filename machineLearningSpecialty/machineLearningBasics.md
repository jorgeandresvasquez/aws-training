## What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed

## Machine Learning Process
1. Provide Input Data
2. Analyze Data
3. Find Patterns
4. Prediction/Decision
5. Learns from the feedback

## Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning
    - The machine learns from the training data that is labeled
    - Ex:  We provide the system with a photo of an apple and let it know its an apple
    - You provide direct feedback
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Non-labeled training data
    - No feedback
    - Used to find out hidden patterns in data
3. Reinforcement Learning
    - The machine learns on its own

## The right machine Learning solution
- Aspects to consider:
    - The problem statement
    - The size, quality, and nature of the data
    - Complexity of the algorithm
- Categories of algorithms:
    1. Classification
        - Used when the output is categorical like 'YES' or 'NO'
        - Algorithms used:
            - Decision Tree
            - Naive Bayes
            - Random Forest
            - Logistic Regression
            - KNN (K Nearest Neighbor)
    2. Regression
        - Used when a value needs to be predicted. (ex:  Stock prices)
        - Algorithms used:
            - Linear Regression
                - Best choice when output is quantitative in nature and directly proportional to the variables
                - Low computation cost
    3. Clustering 
        - Used when the data needs to be organized to find patterns (ex: Product recommendation)
        - Algorithms:
            - K Means
